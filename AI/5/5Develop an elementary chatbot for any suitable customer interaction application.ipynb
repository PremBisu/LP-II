    "5. Develop an Elementary Chatbot for Any Suitable Customer Interaction Application\n",
    "üìå Introduction\n",
    "A chatbot is a software application designed to simulate human conversation through text or voice interactions. It can assist users by answering queries, providing information, or performing simple tasks automatically. Chatbots are widely used in customer interaction applications to enhance user experience, automate repetitive queries, and provide 24/7 support.\n",
    "________________________________________\n",
    "üí° Objective\n",
    "To design and develop a basic chatbot capable of handling elementary customer queries for a specific domain (e.g., hotel booking, e-commerce, technical support, or banking). The chatbot will use predefined rules or simple natural language processing techniques to respond to user inputs.\n",
    "________________________________________\n",
    "üõ†Ô∏è Architecture of an Elementary Chatbot\n",
    "1.\tUser Interface (Frontend)\n",
    "o\tA chat window or form where users input their queries\n",
    "o\tTechnologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or integrated into platforms like Telegram, Messenger, or WhatsApp)\n",
    "2.\tProcessing Engine (Backend)\n",
    "o\tTakes user input and processes it to determine intent and generate a response\n",
    "o\tTechnologies: Python (Flask), Node.js, or other server-side platforms\n",
    "3.\tKnowledge Base / Rule Engine\n",
    "o\tContains predefined responses based on keywords or intents\n",
    "o\tExample: If user types \"What are your working hours?\", reply with \"We‚Äôre open 9 AM to 6 PM, Monday to Friday.\"\n",
    "4.\tResponse Generator\n",
    "o\tReturns the appropriate answer from the rule set or logic to the user via frontend\n",
    "________________________________________\n",
    "üß† Types of Elementary Chatbots\n",
    "1.\tRule-Based Chatbots\n",
    "o\tFollow a tree of if-else statements\n",
    "o\tLimited to predefined questions and answers\n",
    "o\tSimple, fast, but not flexible\n",
    "2.\tKeyword-Based Chatbots\n",
    "o\tSearch for specific keywords in user input and match them to responses\n",
    "o\tSlightly more flexible than rule-based bots\n",
    "3.\tAI-Based (Elementary Level)\n",
    "o\tUse lightweight NLP libraries (e.g., NLTK or spaCy in Python)\n",
    "o\tBasic intent recognition, tokenization, and matching\n",
    "________________________________________\n",
    "üí¨ Example Use Case: E-commerce Customer Support Chatbot\n",
    "Sample Dialog:\n",
    "‚Ä¢\tUser: \"Where is my order?\"\n",
    "‚Ä¢\tBot: \"Please enter your order ID so I can help track it.\"\n",
    "‚Ä¢\tUser: \"What is your return policy?\"\n",
    "‚Ä¢\tBot: \"You can return items within 10 days of delivery. Want to initiate a return?\"\n",
    "________________________________________\n",
    "üõë Limitations of Elementary Chatbots\n",
    "‚Ä¢\tCannot handle complex language or ambiguous questions\n",
    "‚Ä¢\tRestricted to fixed responses and predefined intents\n",
    "‚Ä¢\tNo learning or context awareness over conversations\n",
    "________________________________________\n",
    "üß™ Technologies Used\n",
    "Component\tTools/Tech\n",
    "Frontend\tHTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap\n",
    "Backend\tPython (Flask) / Node.js\n",
    "Logic/Rules\tPython conditions or JSON mappings\n",
    "NLP (optional)\tNLTK, spaCy (for basic parsing)\n",
    "Hosting\tLocalhost or cloud (Render, Heroku)\n",
    "________________________________________\n",
    "‚úÖ Advantages of Using Chatbots for Customer Interaction\n",
    "‚Ä¢\t24/7 availability\n",
    "‚Ä¢\tInstant response to queries\n",
    "‚Ä¢\tReduces burden on human agents\n",
    "‚Ä¢\tImproves customer satisfaction\n",
    "‚Ä¢\tScalability with minimal cost\n",
    "________________________________________\n",
    "üìå Conclusion\n",
    "Developing an elementary chatbot is a stepping stone into the world of conversational AI. Though limited in scope, such bots can significantly enhance customer interaction by automating basic queries. They also provide a practical foundation for building more intelligent AI-driven conversational agents in the future.\n",
